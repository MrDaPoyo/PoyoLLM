      "Row 17: She seldom or never looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for \"style,\" not service--she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.\n",

      "Row 25: \"Y-o-u-u TOM!\"\n",
      "Row 26: There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.\n",

      "Row 43: \"Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything?\n",
      "Row 44: Ain't he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time?\n",

      "Row 46: Can't learn an old dog new tricks, as the saying is.\n",
      "Row 47: But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days, and how is a body to know what's coming?\n",
      "Row 48: He 'pears to know just how long he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it's all down again and I can't hit him a lick.\n",
      "Row 49: I ain't doing my duty by that boy, and that's the Lord's truth, goodness knows.\n",
      "Row 50: Spare the rod and spile the child, as the Good Book says.\n",
      "Row 51: I'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I know.\n",

      "Row 53: Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks.\n",
      "Row 54: Well-a-well, man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says, and I reckon it's so.\n",
      "Row 55: He'll play hookey this evening, * and [* Southwestern for \"afternoon\"] I'll just be obleeged to make him work, tomorrow, to punish him.\n",
      "Row 56: It's mighty hard to make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he hates anything else, and I've _got_ to do some of my duty by him, or I'll be the ruination of the child.\"\n",
      "Row 57: Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time.\n",
      "Row 58: He got back home barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day's wood and split the kindlings before supper--at least he was there in time to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.\n",
      "Row 59: Tom's younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, and had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.\n",
      "Row 60: While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and very deep--for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments.\n",
      "Row 61: Like many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning.\n",
      "Row 62: Said she: \"Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?\"\n",
      "Row 63: \"Yes'm.\"\n",
      "Row 64: \"Powerful warm, warn't it?\"\n",
      "Row 65: \"Yes'm.\"\n",
      "Row 66: \"Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?\"\n",
      "Row 67: A bit of a scare shot through Tom--a touch of uncomfortable suspicion.\n",
      "Row 68: He searched Aunt Polly's face, but it told him nothing.\n",
      "Row 69: So he said: \"No'm--well, not very much.\"\n",
      "Row 70: The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and said: \"But you ain't too warm now, though.\"\n",
      "Row 71: And it flattered her to reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind.\n",
      "Row 72: But in spite of her, Tom knew where the wind lay, now.\n",
      "Row 73: So he forestalled what might be the next move:\n",
      "Row 74: \"Some of us pumped on our heads--mine's damp yet.\n",
      "Row 75: See?\"\n",
      "Row 76: Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick.\n",
      "Row 77: Then she had a new inspiration:\n",
      "Row 78: \"Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump on your head, did you?\n",
      "Row 79: Unbutton your jacket!\"\n",
      "Row 80: The trouble vanished out of Tom's face.\n",
      "Row 81: He opened his jacket.\n",
      "Row 82: His shirt collar was securely sewed.\n",
      "Row 83: \"Bother!\n",
      "Row 84: Well, go 'long with you.\n",
      "Row 85: I'd made sure you'd played hookey and been a-swimming.\n",
      "Row 86: But I forgive ye, Tom.\n",
      "Row 87: I reckon you're a kind of a singed cat, as the saying is--better'n you look. _This_ time.\"\n",
      "Row 88: She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.\n",
      "Row 89: But Sidney said: \"Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread, but it's black.\"\n",
      "Row 90: \"Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!\"\n",
      "Row 91: But Tom did not wait for the rest.\n",
      "Row 92: As he went out at the door he said: \"Siddy, I'll lick you for that.\"\n",
      "Row 93: In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them--one needle carried white thread and the other black.\n",
      "Row 94: He said: \"She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid.\n",
      "Row 95: Confound it! sometimes she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black.\n",
      "Row 96: I wish to gee-miny she'd stick to one or t'other--I can't keep the run of 'em.\n",
      "Row 97: But I bet you I'll lam Sid for that.\n",
      "Row 98: I'll learn him!\"\n",
      "Row 99: He was not the Model Boy of the village.\n",
      "Row 100: He knew the model boy very well though--and loathed him.\n",
      "Row 101: Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles.\n",
      "Row 102: Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man's are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the time--just as men's misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises.\n",
      "Row 103: This new interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed.\n",
      "Row 104: It consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music--the reader probably remembers how to do it, if he has ever been a boy.\n",
      "Row 105: Diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude.\n",
      "Row 106: He felt much as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet--no doubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the astronomer.\n",
      "Row 107: The summer evenings were long.\n",
      "Row 108: It was not dark, yet.\n",
      "Row 109: Presently Tom checked his whistle.\n",
      "Row 110: A stranger was before him--a boy a shade larger than himself.\n",
      "Row 111: A new-comer of any age or either sex was an im-pressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg.\n",
      "Row 112: This boy was well dressed, too--well dressed on a week-day.\n",
      "Row 113: This was simply as astounding.\n",
      "Row 114: His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons.\n",
      "Row 115: He had shoes on--and it was only Friday.\n",
      "Row 116: He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of ribbon.\n",
      "Row 117: He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom's vitals.\n",
      "Row 118: The more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow.\n",
      "Row 119: Neither boy spoke.\n",
      "Row 120: If one moved, the other moved--but only sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the time.\n",
      "Row 121: Finally Tom said:\n",
      "Row 122: \"I can lick you!\"\n",
      "Row 123: \"I'd like to see you try it.\"\n",
      "Row 124: \"Well, I can do it.\"\n",

      "Row 172: After struggling till both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:\n",

      "Row 190: In an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and clothes, punched and scratched each other's nose, and covered themselves with dust and glory.\n",
      "Row 191: Presently the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with his fists.\n",
      "Row 192: \"Holler 'nuff!\" said he.\n",
      "Row 193: The boy only struggled to free himself.\n",

      "Row 200: To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope.\n",
      "Row 201: Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he lived.\n",
      "Row 202: He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined.\n",

      "Row 205: He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness.\n",

      "Row 214: Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden.\n",
      "Row 215: Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged.\n",

      "Row 427: And thus _she_ would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted, so untimely cut down?\n",
      "Row 428: The window went up, a maid-servant's discordant voice profaned the holy calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr's remains!\n",
      "Row 429: The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom.\n",
      "Row 430: Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he had any dim idea of making any \"references to allusions,\" he thought better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom's eye.\n",
      "Row 431: Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made mental note of the omission.\n",
      "Row 432: CHAPTER IV\n",
      "Row 433: THE sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful village like a benediction.\n",
      "Row 434: Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.\n",
      "Row 435: Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to \"get his verses.\"\n",
      "Row 436: Sid had learned his lesson days before.\n",
      "Row 437: Tom bent all his energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.\n",
      "Row 438: At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson, but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations.\n",
      "Row 439: Mary took his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the fog:\n",

      "Row 465: And he did \"tackle it again\"--and under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a shining success.\n",
      "Row 466: Mary gave him a brand-new \"Barlow\" knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system shook him to his foundations.\n",
      "Row 467: True, the knife would not cut anything, but it was a \"sure-enough\" Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur in that--though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps.\n",
      "Row 468: Tom contrived to scarify the cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was called off to dress for Sunday-school.\n",
      "Row 469: Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves; poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door.\n",
      "Row 470: But Mary removed the towel and said: \"Now ain't you ashamed, Tom.\n",
      "Row 471: You mustn't be so bad.\n",
      "Row 472: Water won't hurt you.\"\n",
      "Row 473: Tom was a trifle disconcerted.\n",
      "Row 474: The basin was refilled, and this time he stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath and began.\n",
      "Row 475: When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face.\n",
      "Row 476: But when he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck.\n",
      "Row 477: Mary took him in hand, and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect.\n",
      "Row 478: [He privately smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his own filled his life with bitterness.]\n",
      "Row 479: Then Mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years--they were simply called his \"other clothes\"--and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe.\n",
      "Row 480: The girl \"put him to rights\" after he had dressed himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat.\n",
      "Row 481: He now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him.\n",
      "Row 482: He hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought them out.\n",
      "Row 483: He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he didn't want to do.\n",
      "Row 484: But Mary said, persuasively: \"Please, Tom--that's a good boy.\"\n",
      "Row 485: So he got into the shoes snarling.\n",
      "Row 486: Mary was soon ready, and the three children set out for Sunday-school--a place that Tom hated with his whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.\n",
      "Row 487: Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church service.\n",
      "Row 488: Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily, and the other always remained too--for stronger reasons.\n",
      "Row 489: The church's high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons; the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board tree-box on top of it for a steeple.\n",
      "Row 490: At the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade: \"Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?\"\n",

      "Row 496: Tom exhibited.\n",
      "Row 497: They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.\n",
      "Row 498: Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones.\n",
      "Row 499: He waylaid other boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer.\n",
      "Row 500: He entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy.\n",
      "Row 501: The teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy's hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear him say \"Ouch!\" and got a new reprimand from his teacher.\n",
      "Row 502: Tom's whole class were of a pattern--restless, noisy, and troublesome.\n",
      "Row 503: When they came to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but had to be prompted all along.\n",
      "Row 504: However, they worried through, and each got his reward--in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation.\n",
      "Row 505: Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil.\n",
      "Row 506: How many of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dore Bible?\n",
      "Row 507: And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way--it was the patient work of two years--and a boy of German parentage had won four or five.\n",
      "Row 508: He once recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth--a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always made this boy come out and \"spread himself.\"\n",
      "Row 509: Only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar's heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks.\n",
      "Row 510: It is possible that Tom's mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.\n",
      "Row 511: In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves, and commanded attention.\n",
      "Row 512: When a Sunday-school superintendent makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert--though why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer.\n",
      "Row 513: This superintendent was a slim creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth--a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion of the day, like sleigh-runners--an effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together.\n",
      "Row 514: Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days.\n",
      "Row 515: He began after this fashion: \"Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two.\n",
      "Row 516: There--that is it.\n",
      "Row 517: That is the way good little boys and girls should do.\n",
      "Row 518: I see one little girl who is looking out of the window--I am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere--perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds.\n",
      "Row 519: [Applausive titter.]\n",
      "Row 520: I want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good.\"\n",
      "Row 521: And so forth and so on.\n",
      "Row 522: It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration.\n",
      "Row 523: It was of a pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.\n",
      "Row 524: The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary.\n",
      "Row 525: But now every sound ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters' voice, and the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.\n",
      "Row 526: A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more or less rare--the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter's wife.\n",
      "Row 527: The lady was leading a child.\n",
      "Row 528: Tom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too--he could not meet Amy Lawrence's eye, he could not brook her loving gaze.\n",
      "Row 529: But when he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment.\n",
      "Row 530: The next moment he was \"showing off\" with all his might--cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces--in a word, using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause.\n",
      "Row 531: His exaltation had but one alloy--the memory of his humiliation in this angel's garden--and that record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.\n",
      "Row 532: The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr. Walters' speech was finished, he introduced them to the school.\n",
      "Row 533: The middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage--no less a one than the county judge--altogether the most august creation these children had ever looked upon--and they wondered what kind of material he was made of--and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might, too.\n",
      "Row 534: He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away--so he had travelled, and seen the world--these very eyes had looked upon the county court-house--which was said to have a tin roof.\n",
      "Row 535: The awe which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the ranks of staring eyes.\n",
      "Row 536: This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of their own lawyer.\n",
      "Row 537: Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school.\n",
      "Row 538: It would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings:\n",
      "Row 539: \"Look at him, Jim! He's a going up there.\n",
      "Row 540: Say--look! he's a going to shake hands with him--he _is_ shaking hands with him!\n",
      "Row 541: By jings, don't you wish you was Jeff?\"\n",
      "Row 542: Mr. Walters fell to \"showing off,\" with all sorts of official bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a target.\n",
      "Row 543: The librarian \"showed off\"--running hither and thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in.\n",
      "Row 544: The young lady teachers \"showed off\"--bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers \"showed off\" with small scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to discipline--and most of the teachers, of both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times (with much seeming vexation).\n",
      "Row 545: The little girls \"showed off\" in various ways, and the little boys \"showed off\" with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings.\n",
      "Row 546: And above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur--for he was \"showing off,\" too.\n",
      "Row 547: There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters' ecstasy complete, and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.\n",
      "Row 548: Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough--he had been around among the star pupils inquiring.\n",
      "Row 549: He would have given worlds, now, to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.\n",
      "Row 550: And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a Bible.\n",
      "Row 551: This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky.\n",
      "Row 552: Walters was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten years.\n",
      "Row 553: But there was no getting around it--here were the certified checks, and they were good for their face.\n",
      "Row 554: Tom was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from headquarters.\n",
      "Row 555: It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one's altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of one.\n",
      "Row 556: The boys were all eaten up with envy--but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.\n",
      "Row 557: These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a guileful snake in the grass.\n",
      "Row 558: The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow's instinct taught him that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises--a dozen would strain his capacity, without a doubt.\n",
      "Row 559: Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in her face--but he wouldn't look.\n",
      "Row 560: She wondered; then she was just a grain troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went--came again; she watched; a furtive glance told her worlds--and then her heart broke, and she was jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most of all (she thought).\n",
      "Row 561: Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath would hardly come, his heart quaked--partly because of the awful greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent.\n",
      "Row 562: He would have liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark.\n",
      "Row 563: The Judge put his hand on Tom's head and called him a fine little man, and asked him what his name was.\n",
      "Row 564: The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:\n",
      "Row 565: \"Tom.\" \"Oh, no, not Tom--it is--\"\n",

      "Row 580: That is what you will say, Thomas--and you wouldn't take any money for those two thousand verses--no indeed you wouldn't.\n",
      "Row 581: And now you wouldn't mind telling me and this lady some of the things you've learned--no, I know you wouldn't--for we are proud of little boys that learn.\n",

      "Row 596: Aunt Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her--Tom being placed next the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible.\n",
      "Row 597: The crowd filed up the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days; the mayor and his wife--for they had a mayor there, among other unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair, smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the new notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all the young clerks in town in a body--for they had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as if she were cut glass.\n",
      "Row 598: He always brought his mother to church, and was the pride of all the matrons.\n",

      "Row 602: The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more, to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir in the gallery.\n",

      "Row 604: There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred, but I have forgotten where it was, now.\n",

      "Row 607: His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged down as if from a spring-board: Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow'ry _beds_ of ease,\n",
      "Row 608: Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro' _blood_-y seas?\n",
      "Row 609: He was regarded as a wonderful reader.\n",
      "Row 610: At church \"sociables\" he was always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps, and \"wall\" their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, \"Words cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal earth.\"\n",
      "Row 611: After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a bulletin-board, and read off \"notices\" of meetings and societies and things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of doom--a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities, away here in this age of abundant newspapers.\n",
      "Row 612: Often, the less there is to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.\n",
      "Row 613: And now the minister prayed.\n",
      "Row 614: A good, generous prayer it was, and went into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself; for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a grateful harvest of good.\n",
      "Row 615: Amen.\n",
      "Row 616: There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.\n",
      "Row 617: The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he only endured it--if he even did that much.\n",
      "Row 618: He was restive all through it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously--for he was not listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman's regular route over it--and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly.\n",
      "Row 619: In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe.\n",
      "Row 620: As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom's hands itched to grab for it they did not dare--he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on.\n",
      "Row 621: But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and the instant the \"Amen\" was out the fly was a prisoner of war.\n",
      "Row 622: His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.\n",
      "Row 623: The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod--and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving.\n",
      "Row 624: Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse.\n",
      "Row 625: However, this time he was really interested for a little while.\n",
      "Row 626: The minister made a grand and moving picture of the assembling together of the world's hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead them.\n",
      "Row 627: But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the principal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the thought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion.\n",
      "Row 628: Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.\n",
      "Row 629: Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out.\n",
      "Row 630: It was a large black beetle with formidable jaws--a \"pinchbug,\" he called it.\n",
      "Row 631: It was in a percussion-cap box.\n",
      "Row 632: The first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger.\n",
      "Row 633: A natural fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went into the boy's mouth.\n",
      "Row 634: The beetle lay there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over.\n",
      "Row 635: Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out of his reach.\n",
      "Row 636: Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too.\n",
      "Row 637: Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change.\n",
      "Row 638: He spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted and wagged.\n",
      "Row 639: He surveyed the prize; walked around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded.\n",
      "Row 640: His head nodded, and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy, who seized it.\n",
      "Row 641: There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle's head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on its back once more.\n",
      "Row 642: The neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy.\n",
      "Row 643: The dog looked foolish, and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a craving for revenge.\n",
      "Row 644: So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again.\n",
      "Row 645: But he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat down on it.\n",
      "Row 646: Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light.\n",
      "Row 647: At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang into its master's lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.\n",
      "Row 648: By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.\n",
      "Row 649: The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson had said a rarely facetious thing.\n",
      "Row 650: It was a genuine relief to the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.\n",
      "Row 651: Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety in it.\n",
      "Row 652: He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in him to carry it off.\n",
      "Row 653: CHAPTER VI\n",
      "Row 654: MONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable.\n",
      "Row 655: Monday morning always found him so--because it began another week's slow suffering in school.\n",
      "Row 656: He generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday, it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.\n",
      "Row 657: Tom lay thinking.\n",
      "Row 658: Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was sick; then he could stay home from school.\n",
      "Row 659: Here was a vague possibility.\n",
      "Row 660: He canvassed his system.\n",
      "Row 661: No ailment was found, and he investigated again.\n",
      "Row 662: This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he began to encourage them with considerable hope.\n",
      "Row 663: But they soon grew feeble, and presently died wholly away.\n",
      "Row 664: He reflected further.\n",
      "Row 665: Suddenly he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose.\n",
      "Row 666: This was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a \"starter,\" as he called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt.\n",
      "Row 667: So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.\n",
      "Row 668: Nothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger.\n",
      "Row 669: So the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.\n",
      "Row 670: But now he did not know the necessary symptoms.\n",
      "Row 671: However, it seemed well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit.\n",
      "Row 672: But Sid slept on unconscious.\n",
      "Row 673: Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.\n",
      "Row 674: No result from Sid.\n",
      "Row 675: Tom was panting with his exertions by this time.\n",
      "Row 676: He took a rest and then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.\n",
      "Row 677: Sid snored on.\n",
      "Row 678: Tom was aggravated.\n",
      "Row 679: He said, \"Sid, Sid!\" and shook him.\n",
      "Row 680: This course worked well, and Tom began to groan again.\n",
      "Row 681: Sid yawned, stretched, then brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.\n",
      "Row 682: Tom went on groaning. Sid said:\n",
      "Row 683: \"Tom! Say, Tom!\"\n",

      "Row 961: And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and looked pleased, nevertheless.\n",
      "Row 962: Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his ear, and a steady lifting impulse.\n",
      "Row 963: In that wise he was borne across the house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles from the whole school.\n",

      "Row 965: But although Tom's ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.\n",
      "Row 966: As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but the turmoil within him was too great.\n",
      "Row 967: In turn he took his place in the reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into continents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and got \"turned down,\" by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with ostentation for months.\n",

      "Row 969: THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas wandered.\n",

      "Row 976: Away off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible but some cows, and they were asleep.\n",
      "Row 977: Tom's heart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.\n",
      "Row 978: His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it.\n",
      "Row 979: Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out.\n",
      "Row 980: He released the tick and put him on the long flat desk.\n",
      "Row 981: The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction.\n",
      "Row 982: Tom's bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an instant.\n",

      "Row 986: The sport grew in interest momently.\n",
      "Row 987: Soon Tom said that they were interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit of the tick.\n",
      "Row 988: So he put Joe's slate on the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom. \"Now,\" said he, \"as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and I'll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side, you're to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.\"\n",

      "Row 990: The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator.\n",

      "Row 992: This change of base occurred often.\n",
      "Row 993: While one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all things else.\n",
      "Row 994: At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe.\n",
      "Row 995: The tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom's fingers would be twitching to begin, Joe's pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession.\n",
      "Row 996: At last Tom could stand it no longer.\n",
      "Row 997: The temptation was too strong.\n",
      "Row 998: So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin.\n",
      "Row 999: Joe was angry in a moment. Said he:\n",

      "Row 1011: The boys had been too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them.\n",

      "Row 1674: He had been careful to begin both of his inquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery that preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in the courts at present.\n",

      "Row 1772: Then one more frock passed in at the gate, and Tom's heart gave a great bound.\n",
      "Row 1773: The next instant he was out, and \"going on\" like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys, jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings, standing on his head--doing all the heroic things he could conceive of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher was noticing.\n",
      "Row 1774: But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never looked.\n",
      "Row 1775: Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there?\n",
      "Row 1776: He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping around, snatched a boy's cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse, broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and fell sprawling, himself, under Becky's nose, almost upsetting her--and she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: \"Mf! some people think they're mighty smart--always showing off!\"\n",
      "Row 1777: Tom's cheeks burned.\n",
      "Row 1778: He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and crestfallen.\n",

      "Row 1780: TOM'S mind was made up now.\n",
      "Row 1781: He was gloomy and desperate.\n",
      "Row 1782: He was a forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame _him_ for the consequences--why shouldn't they?\n",
      "Row 1783: What right had the friendless to complain?\n",
      "Row 1784: Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would lead a life of crime. There was no choice.\n",
      "Row 1785: By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to \"take up\" tinkled faintly upon his ear.\n",
      "Row 1786: He sobbed, now, to think he should never, never hear that old familiar sound any more--it was very hard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold world, he must submit--but he forgave them.\n",
      "Row 1787: Then the sobs came thick and fast.\n",
      "Row 1788: Just at this point he met his soul's sworn comrade, Joe Harper--hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart.\n",
      "Row 1789: Plainly here were \"two souls with but a single thought.\"\n",
      "Row 1790: Tom, wiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping that Joe would not forget him.\n",
      "Row 1791: But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose.\n",
      "Row 1792: His mother had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and knew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished him to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but succumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.\n",
      "Row 1793: As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved them of their troubles.\n",
      "Row 1794: Then they began to lay their plans.\n",
      "Row 1795: Joe was for being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying, some time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.\n",
      "Row 1796: Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island, with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a rendezvous.\n",
      "Row 1797: It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest.\n",
      "Row 1798: So Jackson's Island was chosen.\n",
      "Row 1799: Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a matter that did not occur to them.\n",

      "Row 1801: They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour--which was midnight.\n",
      "Row 1802: There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture.\n",
      "Row 1803: Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal in the most dark and mysterious way--as became outlaws.

      "Row 1804: All who got this vague hint were cautioned to \"be mum and wait.\"\n",
      "Row 1805: About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles, and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the meeting-place.\n",

      "Row 1807: The mighty river lay like an ocean at rest.\n",

      "Row 1820: Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the brooding night: \"_Blood_!\"\n",
      "Row 1821: Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it, tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort.\n",
      "Row 1822: There was an easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.\n",
      "Row 1823: The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn himself out with getting it there.\n",
      "Row 1824: Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought a few corn-cobs to make pipes with.\n",

      "Row 1826: The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it would never do to start without some fire.\n",

      "Row 1829: They made an imposing adventure of it, saying, \"Hist!\" every now and then, and suddenly halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal whispers that if \"the foe\" stirred, to \"let him have it to the hilt,\" because \"dead men tell no tales.\"\n",
      "Row 1830: They knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying in stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.\n",
      "Row 1831: They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and Joe at the forward.\n",
      "Row 1832: Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:\n",

      "Row 1863: About two o'clock in the morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island, and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight.\n",
      "Row 1864: Part of the little raft's belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions; but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as became outlaws.\n",
      "Row 1865: They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn \"pone\" stock they had brought.\n",
      "Row 1866: It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild, free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island, far from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to civilization.\n",
      "Row 1867: The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the varnished foliage and festooning vines.\n",

      "Row 1916: Then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep--but an intruder came, now, that would not \"down.\"\n",
      "Row 1917: They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only \"hooking,\" while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing--and there was a command against that in the Bible.\n",

      "Row 1931: A little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and \"sniffing around,\" then proceeding again--for he was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling, by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom's leg and began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad--for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes--without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform.\n",
      "Row 1932: Now a procession of ants appeared, from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms, and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk.\n",
      "Row 1933: A brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and said, \"Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children's alone,\" and she took wing and went off to see about it--which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once.\n",
      "Row 1934: A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead.\n",
      "Row 1935: The birds were fairly rioting by this time.\n",
      "Row 1936: A catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom's head, and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig almost within the boy's reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the \"fox\" kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.\n",
      "Row 1937: All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.\n",
      "Row 1938: Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar.\n",
      "Row 1939: They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water.\n",
      "Row 1940: A vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only gratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge between them and civilization.\n",
      "Row 1941: They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again.\n",
      "Row 1942: Huck found a spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee.\n",
      "Row 1943: While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in their lines; almost immediately they had reward.\n",
      "Row 1944: Joe had not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass, a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish--provisions enough for quite a family.\n",
      "Row 1945: They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before.\n",
      "Row 1946: They did not know that the quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping, open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.\n",
      "Row 1947: They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke, and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition.\n",

      "Row 1952: They were too hungry to stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw themselves down in the shade to talk.\n",
      "Row 1953: But the talk soon began to drag, and then died.\n",
      "Row 1954: The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods, and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys.\n",
      "Row 1955: They fell to thinking.\n",
      "Row 1956: A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This took dim shape, presently--it was budding homesickness.\n",

      "Row 1961: The boys started, glanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude.\n",
      "Row 1962: There was a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came floating down out of the distance.\n",
      "Row 1963: \"What is it!\" exclaimed Joe, under his breath.\n",
      "Row 1964: \"I wonder,\" said Tom in a whisper.\n",
      "Row 1965: \"'Tain't thunder,\" said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, \"becuz thunder--\"\n",
      "Row 1966: \"Hark!\" said Tom. \"Listen--don't talk.\"\n",
      "Row 1967: They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom troubled the solemn hush.\n",
      "Row 1968: \"Let's go and see.\"\n",
      "Row 1969: They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town.\n",
      "Row 1970: They parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water.\n",
      "Row 1971: The little steam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the current.\n",
      "Row 1972: Her broad deck seemed crowded with people.\n",
      "Row 1973: There were a great many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in them were doing.\n",
      "Row 1974: Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboat's side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.\n",
      "Row 1975: \"I know now!\" exclaimed Tom; \"somebody's drownded!\"\n",
      "Row 1976: \"That's it!\" said Huck; \"they done that last summer, when Bill Turner got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes him come up to the top.\n",
      "Row 1977: Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put quicksilver in 'em and set 'em afloat, and wherever there's anybody that's drownded, they'll float right there and stop.\"\n",
      "Row 1978: \"Yes, I've heard about that,\" said Joe.\n",
      "Row 1979: \"Oh, it ain't the bread, so much,\" said Tom; \"I reckon it's mostly what they _say_ over it before they start it out.\"\n",
      "Row 1980: \"But they don't say anything over it,\" said Huck. \"I've seen 'em and they don't.\"\n",
      "Row 1981: \"Well, that's funny,\" said Tom. \"But maybe they say it to themselves.\n",
      "Row 1982: Of _course_ they do.\n",
      "Row 1983: Anybody might know that.\"\n",
      "Row 1984: The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because an ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such gravity.\n",
      "Row 1985: \"By jings, I wish I was over there, now,\" said Joe.\n",
      "Row 1986: \"I do too\" said Huck \"I'd give heaps to know who it is.\"\n",
      "Row 1987: The boys still listened and watched.\n",
      "Row 1988: Presently a revealing thought flashed through Tom's mind, and he exclaimed:\n",
      "Row 1989: They felt like heroes in an instant.\n",
      "Row 1990: Here was a gorgeous triumph; they were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account; tears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being indulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town, and the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was concerned.\n",
      "Row 1991: This was fine.\n",
      "Row 1992: It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.\n",
      "Row 1993: As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business and the skiffs disappeared.\n",
      "Row 1994: The pirates returned to camp.\n",
      "Row 1995: They were jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble they were making.\n",
      "Row 1996: They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them; and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were gratifying to look upon--from their point of view.\n",
      "Row 1997: But when the shadows of night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing into the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere.\n",
      "Row 1998: The excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as much as they were.\n",
      "Row 1999: Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a sigh or two escaped, unawares.\n",
      "Row 2000: By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a roundabout \"feeler\" as to how the others might look upon a return to civilization--not right now, but--\n",
      "Row 2001: Tom withered him with derision!\n",
      "Row 2002: Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined in with Tom, and the waverer quickly \"explained,\" and was glad to get out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness clinging to his garments as he could.\n",
      "Row 2003: Mutiny was effectually laid to rest for the moment.\n",
      "Row 2004: As the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore.\n",
      "Row 2005: Joe followed next.\n",
      "Row 2006: Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time, watching the two intently.\n",
      "Row 2007: At last he got up cautiously, on his knees, and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung by the campfire.\n",
      "Row 2008: He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed to suit him.\n",
      "Row 2009: Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something upon each of these with his \"red keel\"; one he rolled up and put in his jacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe's hat and removed it to a little distance from the owner.\n",
      "Row 2010: And he also put into the hat certain schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value--among them a lump of chalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind of marbles known as a \"sure 'nough crystal.\"\n",
      "Row 2011: Then he tiptoed his way cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.\n",
      "Row 2012: CHAPTER XV\n",
      "Row 2013: A few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward the Illinois shore.\n",
      "Row 2014: Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway over; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards.\n",
      "Row 2015: He swam quartering upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had expected.\n",
      "Row 2016: However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till he found a low place and drew himself out.\n",
      "Row 2017: He put his hand on his jacket pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods, following the shore, with streaming garments.\n",
      "Row 2018: Shortly before ten o'clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank.\n",
      "Row 2019: Everything was quiet under the blinking stars.\n",
      "Row 2020: He crept down the bank, watching with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes and climbed into the skiff that did \"yawl\" duty at the boat's stern.\n",
      "Row 2021: He laid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.\n",
      "Row 2022: Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to \"cast off.\"\n",
      "Row 2023: A minute or two later the skiff's head was standing high up, against the boat's swell, and the voyage was begun.\n",
      "Row 2024: Tom felt happy in his success, for he knew it was the boat's last trip for the night.\n",
      "Row 2025: At the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.\n",
      "Row 2026: He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his aunt's back fence.\n",
      "Row 2027: He climbed over, approached the \"ell,\" and looked in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there.\n",
      "Row 2028: There sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper's mother, grouped together, talking.\n",
      "Row 2029: They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the door.\n",
      "Row 2030: Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began, warily.\n",
      "Row 2031: \"What makes the candle blow so?\" said Aunt Polly.\n",
      "Row 2032: Tom hurried up.\n",
      "Row 2033: \"Why, that door's open, I believe.\n",

      "Row 2043: And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would break.\n",

      "Row 2059: But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely down.\n",

      "Row 2062: He began to have a nobler opinion of himself than ever before.\n",
      "Row 2063: Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt's grief to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy--and the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his nature, too, but he resisted and lay still.\n",
      "Row 2064: He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim; then the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing lads had promised that the village should \"hear something\" soon; the wise-heads had \"put this and that together\" and decided that the lads had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below, presently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village--and then hope perished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home by nightfall if not sooner.\n",
      "Row 2065: It was believed that the search for the bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must have occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would otherwise have escaped to shore.\n",
      "Row 2066: This was Wednesday night.\n",
      "Row 2067: If the bodies continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the funerals would be preached on that morning.\n",

      "Row 2072: Sid snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.\n",
      "Row 2073: Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly, and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice, that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.\n",
      "Row 2074: He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and turning over.\n",
      "Row 2075: But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her sleep.\n",
      "Row 2076: Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the candle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her.\n",
      "Row 2077: His heart was full of pity for her.\n",

      "Row 2082: He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and slept like a graven image.\n",
      "Row 2083: He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream.\n",
      "Row 2084: When he had pulled a mile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself stoutly to his work.\n",
      "Row 2085: He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for this was a familiar bit of work to him.\n",
      "Row 2086: He was moved to capture the skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be made for it and that might end in revelations.\n",
      "Row 2087: So he stepped ashore and entered the woods.\n",
      "Row 2088: He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch.\n",
      "Row 2089: The night was far spent.\n",
      "Row 2090: It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the island bar.\n",

      "Row 2092: A little later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and heard Joe say: \"No, Tom's true-blue, Huck, and he'll come back.\n",

      "Row 2100: \"Which he is!\" exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping grandly into camp.\n",
      "Row 2101: A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.\n",
      "Row 2102: They were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done.\n",
      "Row 2103: Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the other pirates got ready to fish and explore.\n",

      "Row 2105: AFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar.\n",

      "Row 2108: They were perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut.\n",
      "Row 2109: They had a famous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.\n",
      "Row 2110: After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.\n",
      "Row 2111: And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each other's faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing, sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.\n",
      "Row 2112: When they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry, hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by break for the water again and go through the original performance once more.\n",
      "Row 2113: Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented flesh-colored \"tights\" very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and had a circus--with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest post to his neighbor.\n",
      "Row 2114: Next they got their marbles and played \"knucks\" and \"ringtaw\" and \"keeps\" till that amusement grew stale.\n",
      "Row 2115: Then Joe and Huck had another swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the protection of this mysterious charm.\n",
      "Row 2116: He did not venture again until he had found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to rest.\n",
      "Row 2117: They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the \"dumps,\" and fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay drowsing in the sun.\n",

      "Row 2187: He made a plausible excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.\n",

      "Row 2260: Now a weird flash turned night into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and distinct, that grew about their feet.\n",

      "Row 2270: One blinding flash after another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder.\n",
      "Row 2271: And now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground.\n",
      "Row 2272: The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly.\n",
      "Row 2273: However, one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared, and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something to be grateful for.\n",
      "Row 2274: They could not talk, the old sail flapped so furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them.\n",
      "Row 2275: The tempest rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast.\n",
      "Row 2276: The boys seized each others' hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank.\n",
      "Row 2277: Now the battle was at its highest.\n",
      "Row 2278: Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting veil of rain.\n",
      "Row 2279: Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging thunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp, and unspeakably appalling.\n",
      "Row 2280: The storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to the treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one and the same moment.\n",
      "Row 2281: It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out in.\n",
      "Row 2282: But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway.\n",
      "Row 2283: The boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were not under it when the catastrophe happened.\n",
      "Row 2284: Everything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against rain.\n",
      "Row 2285: Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and chilled.\n",
      "Row 2286: They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again.\n",
      "Row 2287: Then they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were gladhearted once more.\n",
      "Row 2288: They dried their boiled ham and had a feast, and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep on, anywhere around.\n",
      "Row 2289: As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over them, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep.\n",
      "Row 2290: They got scorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast.\n",
      "Row 2291: After the meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once more.\n",
      "Row 2292: Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as he could.\n",
      "Row 2293: But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or anything.\n",
      "Row 2294: He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of cheer.\n",
      "Row 2295: While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change.\n",
      "Row 2296: They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many zebras--all of them chiefs, of course--and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an English settlement.\n",
      "Row 2297: By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each other by thousands.\n",
      "Row 2298: It was a gory day.\n",
      "Row 2299: Consequently it was an extremely satisfactory one.\n",
      "Row 2300: They assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now a difficulty arose--hostile Indians could not break the bread of hospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace.\n",
      "Row 2301: There was no other process that ever they had heard of.\n",
      "Row 2302: Two of the savages almost wished they had remained pirates.\n",
      "Row 2303: However, there was no other way; so with such show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and took their whiff as it passed, in due form.\n",
      "Row 2304: And behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable.\n",
      "Row 2305: They were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort.\n",
      "Row 2306: No, they practised cautiously, after supper, with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening.\n",
      "Row 2307: They were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations.\n",
      "Row 2308: We will leave them to smoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at present.\n",

      "Row 2326: Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and many claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or less tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided who _did_ see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them, the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance, and were gaped at and envied by all the rest.\n",
      "Row 2327: One poor chap, who had no other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the remembrance: \"Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.\"\n",

      "Row 2333: The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event.\n",
      "Row 2334: But there was no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there.\n",

      "Row 2340: The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the departed, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the people could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes were, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had seemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide.\n",
      "Row 2341: The congregation became more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus of anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and crying in the pulpit.\n",

      "Row 2768: A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of \"fine language\"; another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them.\n",

      "Row 3297: They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel.\n",
      "Row 3298: The thing failed this time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.\n",

      "Row 3519: The tavern-keeper's young son said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody go into it or come out of it except at night; he did not know any particular reason for this state of things; had had some little curiosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was \"ha'nted\"; had noticed that there was a light in there the night before.\n",
      "Row 3520: \"That's what I've found out, Huck.\n",
      "Row 3521: I reckon that's the very No. 2 we're after.\"\n",

      "Row 3527: The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap of a brick store.\n",
      "Row 3528: Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and I'll nip all of auntie's, and the first dark night we'll go there and try 'em.\n",
      "Row 3529: And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge.\n",
      "Row 3530: If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don't go to that No. 2, that ain't the place.\"\n",
      "Row 3531: \"Lordy, I don't want to foller him by myself!\"\n",
      "Row 3532: \"Why, it'll be night, sure.\n",
      "Row 3533: He mightn't ever see you--and if he did, maybe he'd never think anything.\"\n",

      "Row 3535: I dono--I dono.\n",
      "Row 3536: I'll try.\" \"You bet I'll follow him, if it's dark, Huck.\n",
      "Row 3537: Why, he might 'a' found out he couldn't get his revenge, and be going right after that money.\"\n",
      "Row 3538: \"It's so, Tom, it's so.\n",
      "Row 3539: I'll foller him; I will, by jingoes!\"\n",

      "Row 3542: CHAPTER XXVIII\n",
      "Row 3543: THAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure.\n",
      "Row 3544: They hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern door.\n",
      "Row 3545: Nobody entered the alley or left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern door.\n",
      "Row 3546: The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck was to come and \"maow,\" whereupon he would slip out and try the keys.\n",
      "Row 3547: But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.\n",
      "Row 3548: Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck.\n",
      "Row 3549: Also Wednesday.\n",
      "Row 3550: But Thursday night promised better.\n",
      "Row 3551: Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt's old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with.\n",
      "Row 3552: He hid the lantern in Huck's sugar hogshead and the watch began.\n",
      "Row 3553: An hour before midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts) were put out.\n",
      "Row 3554: No Spaniard had been seen.\n",
      "Row 3555: Nobody had entered or left the alley.\n",
      "Row 3556: Everything was auspicious.\n",
      "Row 3557: The blackness of darkness reigned, the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant thunder.\n",
      "Row 3558: Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern. Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley.\n",
      "Row 3559: Then there was a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck's spirits like a mountain.\n",
      "Row 3560: He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern--it would frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive yet.\n",
      "Row 3561: It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared.\n",
      "Row 3562: Surely he must have fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and excitement.\n",
      "Row 3563: In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away his breath.\n",
      "Row 3564: There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the way it was beating.\n",
      "Row 3565: Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came tearing by him: \"Run!\" said he; \"run, for your life!\"\n",
      "Row 3566: He needn't have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered.\n",
      "Row 3567: The boys never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the lower end of the village.\n",
      "Row 3568: Just as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down.\n",
      "Row 3569: As soon as Tom got his breath he said: \"Huck, it was awful!\n",
      "Row 3570: I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could; but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn't hardly get my breath I was so scared.\n",
      "Row 3571: They wouldn't turn in the lock, either.\n",
      "Row 3572: Well, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and open comes the door!\n",
      "Row 3573: It warn't locked!\n",
      "Row 3574: I hopped in, and shook off the towel, and, _Great Caesar's Ghost!_\"\n",
